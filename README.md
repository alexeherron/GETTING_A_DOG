# GETTING_A_DOG
Well, we've finally decided to get a dog! Today! So naturally, I scoured the Lawrence Humane Society's website and chose my top picks.
And like any rational person, I'd like to have all of their info (name, breed, age, etc...) in a spreadsheet.
But the thought of doing so much copying and pasting from all of their webpages seemed annoying, so I scraped the pages instead. Fun!
This was a simple project using BeautifulSoup, pandas, and requests, in a jupyter notebook, culminating in a small, but satisfying csv file.
